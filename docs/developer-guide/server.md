# AgentUp.Server

`AgentUp.Server` owns all runtime state and performs all orchestration.

## Responsibilities

The Server manages:

- Workspace registry.
- Process lifecycle.
- Port allocation.
- Docker lifecycle.
- Browser lifecycle.
- Browser profiles.
- Browser session persistence.
- Event recording.
- Diagnostics.
- Health monitoring.
- Playwright generation.
- MCP server.
- REST API.

## Single Source of Truth

Desktop, CLI, and MCP clients connect to the Server. They do not keep authoritative copies of workspace state.

## Service Hosting

Packaged installations run `AgentUp.Server` as the local `agent-up-server` service:

- macOS uses launchd.
- Windows uses Windows Service hosting.
- Ubuntu uses systemd.
- NixOS uses a systemd service definition through a Nix module.

This service shape is packaging and lifecycle behavior only. Runtime ownership remains unchanged: all orchestration stays in `AgentUp.Server`, and Desktop stays a client.

This rule keeps concurrent agents, human developers, and automation clients aligned around the same running environment.

## Orchestration Rule

If a feature starts, stops, restarts, navigates, records, allocates, diagnoses, or exports workspace behavior, that logic belongs in the Server.

## Tutorial Cleanup

`POST /api/workspaces/tutorial/cleanup` is a Desktop onboarding support endpoint. It stops and removes every registered workspace when the first-run tutorial starts, so stale workspace state cannot render behind onboarding or affect the guided sample setup.
